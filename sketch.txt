--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PACKAGES
client package and server package


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CLIENT
Object:
		Player:
			- playerName
			- playerId (Created on server)
			+ toString(): playerName

(+) LOGIN form:
	Button:
		Join button to register with server
	
After player "join", server saves his/her info on server-side application (specifically ArrayList<Player>) by using
	
Client-side: ObjectOutputStream, OutputStream (Socket)
	Get OutputStream from the socket
	Place OutputStream inside constructor of ObjectOuputStream
	Write the object to the server


Server-side: InputStream (Socket), ObjectInputStream
	Get InputStream from the socket
	Place InputStream inside constructor of ObjectInputStream
	Read the object, then add it to ArrayList<Player>

(+) ROOM form:
After the Login form, Room form display. The server write the ArrayList<Player> listPlayers back to the client. 
Convert ArrayList to Vector<Player>(ArrayList<Player>).
Use the ListBox with DefaultListModel to display the name of player.
	+ No player or 1 player, display a message "No player. Please Wait."
	+ >= 2 player, update the list

Maybe client have thread with "while(true)" to always update the list of player on real-time.
Maybe create a class named Invitation(String senderName, String senderId, String receiverId).
Maybe a thread with functionality: invite and accept/reject on both client and server.
socket.setKeepAlive(true)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SERVER
Object:
	PlayerAndSocketInfo
		+ PlayerAndSocketInfo(String playerId, Socket acceptFromPlayer, ObjectInputStream, ObjectOuputStream)

Server-side app have 3 threads:
	- Register thread
	- LoadPlayerLists thread
	- Invitation thread
	- PlayGames thread
	

Server-side have 
		 ArrayList<Player>
		 ArrayList<PlayerAndSocketInfo>
		<NEW> ArrayList<Player> listPlayingPlayers

<Old one> Client-side: FileOutputStream, FileInputStream, ObjectOutputStream, OutputStream (Socket)
	Use FileOutputStream constructor with the name: playerId_obj.txt
	Use ObjectOutputStream construtor with FileOutputStream, use writeObject(Player) to write on the text file.
	Use FileInputStream with the existent text file
	Use OutputStream from the socket to send the file to server
<Old once> Server-side: InputStream, FileOutputStream, FileInputStream, ObjectInputStream
	Use InputStream to receive the file, then use FileOutputStream to write to a new file named "PXX_obj.txt"
	Use ObjectInputStream with FileInputStream to read the object
	Add the object to ArrayList<Player>
